# SE-Assignment-2
Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Define Software Engineering:

Software Engineering is a discipline that applies engineering principles to the design, development, testing, and maintenance of software systems. It encompasses systematic approaches to efficiently and reliably produce high-quality software that meets user requirements.
Software Engineering vs. Traditional Programming:

Software engineering involves a systematic and structured approach to software development, focusing not only on writing code but also on requirements analysis, design, testing, and maintenance. Traditional programming often refers to writing code without necessarily following a structured process or considering broader software development principles.

Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) Phases of SDLC:  
Planning: Define project goals, scope, resources, and schedule. 
 Requirements Analysis: Gather and analyze user needs.
 Design: Create architecture and design specifications.
 Implementation (Coding): Write and compile code. 
Testing: Verify and validate the software works as intended.
 Deployment: Release software to users. 
Maintenance: Provide ongoing support and updates. 


Agile vs. Waterfall Models:

Agile emphasizes iterative development, flexibility, and customer collaboration. It breaks the project into small increments and encourages adaptive planning. Waterfall follows a linear, sequential approach, with each phase dependent on the completion of the previous one. Agile is preferred for projects with changing requirements, while Waterfall is suitable for well-defined, stable projects.
Requirements Engineering:

Requirements engineering involves eliciting, analyzing, documenting, and validating user needs and system requirements. It ensures that the software meets user expectations and business objectives. Requirements engineering is crucial for identifying project scope, minimizing rework, and delivering a successful product.
Software Design Principles:

Modularity in software design refers to breaking down a system into smaller, cohesive, and interchangeable components. It improves maintainability by isolating changes to specific modules and enhances scalability by allowing easy addition or removal of functionality.
Testing in Software Engineering:

Software testing includes various levels: unit testing (testing individual components), integration testing (testing interactions between components), system testing (testing the entire system), and acceptance testing (testing against user requirements). Testing is crucial for identifying defects early, ensuring software quality, and validating functionality.
Version Control Systems:

Version control systems track changes to source code and facilitate collaboration among developers. Examples include Git, Subversion. They offer features like branching, merging, and history tracking, enabling teams to manage code effectively and rollback to previous versions if needed.
Software Project Management:

A software project manager oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects. Key responsibilities include project planning, resource allocation, risk management, and stakeholder communication. Challenges include managing scope changes, resolving conflicts, and meeting deadlines within budget constraints.
Software Maintenance:

Software maintenance involves modifying and updating software after its initial release to address defects, improve performance, or adapt to changing requirements. Types of maintenance activities include corrective, adaptive, perfective, and preventive maintenance. Maintenance is essential for ensuring software remains functional, reliable, and aligned with user needs.
Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:

Ethical issues in software engineering may include privacy violations, data breaches, biased algorithms, and unauthorized use of intellectual property. Software engineers can adhere to ethical standards by practicing transparency, respecting user privacy, ensuring security measures, and continuously evaluating the societal impact of their work.
